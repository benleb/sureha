This is a fork from the original SureHA custom component provided by @benleb.
The goal of this fork is to provide improvements on some areas...
Unfortunately, I don't own some of the devices, like felaqua or feeder, therefore, I cannot validate and test changes I've made there.

If you are interested in testing and providing feedback, please let me know in the discussions.

### binary_sensor.flap_connectivity


## Services

This project allows you to use the following services in Home Assistant:<br>

### SureHA: Set Pet location<br>
 
  This service call allows you to update the location of a pet. <br>
  Data needed:<br>
    - pet_id = this is the surepetcare id for your pet. <br>
    - where = options are "Inside" or "Outside"

example:
```yaml
service: sureha.set_pet_location
data:
  pet_id: 31337
  where: Inside
```

### SureHA: Set lock state

  This service call allows you to update the lock state of a flap.
  
  Data needed:<br>
    - flap_id = this is the surepetcare id for the flap you want to change.<br>
    - lock_state = 
  
 example:
 ```yaml
 service: sureha.set_lock_state
data:
  flap_id: 123456
  lock_state: locked
```


## Useful stuff

The following script and button card code was create by xbmcnut to set pets location to inside
```yaml
script:
  set_kobe_inside:
    alias: 'Set Kobe Inside'
    sequence:
      - service: sureha.set_pet_location
        data:
          pet_id: '123456' #Kobe's Code
          where: Inside      
```

Button card code:
```yaml
entity: binary_sensor.pet_kobe
icon: mdi:cat
layout: icon_name_state
show_name: false
show_state: true
styles:
  icon:
    - color: >
        [[[ if (states['binary_sensor.pet_kobe'].state === 'on') return "green";
        return "red"; ]]]
tap_action:
  action: more-info
hold_action:
  action: call-service
  service: script.set_kobe_inside
type: custom:button-card
```

The following script was created by sasgoose to toggle the location of a pet

```yaml
script:
  toggle_thorin_location:
      alias: 'Toggle Thorin location'
      sequence:
        choose:
        - conditions:
            - condition: state
              entity_id: binary_sensor.pet_thorin_2
              attribute: where
              state: 1
          sequence:
            - service: sureha.set_pet_location
              data:
                pet_id: '123456' # Thorin's pet id
                where: Outside
        - conditions:
            - condition: state
              entity_id: binary_sensor.pet_thorin_2
              attribute: where
              state: 2
          sequence:
            - service: sureha.set_pet_location
              data:
                pet_id: '123456' # Thorin's pet id
                where: Inside
                
```


## Upgrade *surepetcarebeta* to *sureha*

Do a backup of your HA first. Its probably not needed but a backup is never a bad idea ;)  
The cleanest way will be to delete the *surepetcarebeta* integration completely and handle *sureha* completely independent. It will create the same entity/unique ids as before so your automations and graphs should not be affected.

## enable the debug logging in `configuration.yaml` if something does not work as expected

```yaml
# logging
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    surepy: debug
    custom_components.sureha: debug
    custom_components.sureha.binary_sensor: debug
    custom_components.sureha.sensor: debug
```

## Naming confusion for *surepetcarebeta* users üêæ ü§™ ü§¶

Sorry for the bad naming and resulting confusion and chaos üôÑ To "fix" this, I **renamed *surepetcarebeta* to *sureha***.
